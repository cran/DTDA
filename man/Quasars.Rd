\title{ Quasars Data
}
\description{
The original dataset studied by Efron and Petrosian (1999) comprised independlently collected quadruplets of the redshift and the apparent magnitude of a quasar object. Due to experiemtnal constraints, the distribution of each luminosity in a log-scale is truncated to a known interval.

\usage{data(Quasars)}
\format{
  A data frame with 210 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{y (adj lum)}}{a numeric vector, the log lominosity values.}
    \item{\code{u (lower)}}{a numeric vector, lower truncation limits.}
    \item{\code{v (upper)}}{a numeric vector, upper truncation limits.}

\details{
Quadruplets in the original data set studied by \cite{Efron and Petrosian (1999)} are of the form \eqn{(z_i;m_i; a_i; b_i), i = 1, \ldots n}, where \eqn{z_i} is the redshift of the ith quasar and
\eqn{m_i} is the apparent magnitude. Due to experimental constraints, the distribution of each luminosity in the log-scale \eqn{(y_i = t(z_i, m_i))} is truncated to a known interval \eqn{[a_i; b_i]}, where \eqn{t}
represents a transformation which depends on the cosmological model assumed (see \cite{Efron
and Petrosian (1999)} for details). Quasars with apparent magnitude above \eqn{b_i} were too dim to yield dependent redshifts, and hence they were excluded from the study. The lower limit \eqn{a_i}
was used to avoid confusion with non quasar stellar objects.
