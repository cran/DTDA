}
\description{
The original data set studied by Efron and Petrosian (1999), comprised independently collected
quadruplets \eqn{(z_i;m_i; a_i; b_i), i = 1, \ldots n}, where \eqn{z_i} is the redshift of the ith quasar and
\eqn{m_i} is the apparent magnitude. Due to experimental constraints, the distribution of each
luminosity in the log-scale \eqn{(y_i = t(z_i, m_i))} is truncated to a known interval \eqn{[a_i; b_i]}, where \eqn{t}
represents a transformation which depends on the cosmological model assumed (see Efron
and Petrosian (1999) for details). Quasars with apparent magnitude above \eqn{b_i} were too dim to
yield dependent redshifts, and hence they were excluded from the study. The lower limit \eqn{a_i}
was used to avoid confusion with non quasar stellar objects.
