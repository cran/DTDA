\title{
Doubly truncated data analysis
}
\description{
This package implements different algorithms for analyzing randomly truncated data, one-sided and two-sided (i.e. doubly) truncated data.
It incorporates the iterative methods introduced by Efron and Petrosian (1999) and Shen (2008).
Estimation of the lifetime distribution function and truncation times distributions is possible, together with the corresponding pointwise confidence limits based on bootstrap methods.
Plots of cumulative distributions and survival functions are provided. Two real data sets are included: right-truncated
AIDS data and doubly truncated data on quasar luminosities.

Missing data are allowed. Registries with missing data are simply removed. This package incorporates the functions \code{efron.petrosian}, \code{lynden} and \code{ shen}, which call the iterative methods introduced by Efron and Petrosian (1999) and Shen (2008).
