Description: Implementation of different algorithms for analyzing
        randomly truncated data, one-sided and two-sided (i.e. doubly)
        truncated data. It serves to compute empirical cumulative 
        distributions and also kernel density and hazard functions 
        using different bandwidth selectors.
      Several real data sets are included.
